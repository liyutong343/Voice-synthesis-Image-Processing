# Voice-synthesis-Image-Processing
大二夏/Matlab高级编程与工程应用/大作业

In summer of 2022 I took the MATLAB course, which is pretty necessary for a student learning EE. After taking the classes, each of us should finish 2 homework projects out of 4. I chose the voice synthesis and image processing. Actually those 2 are quite easy and the functions they fulfill were not as useful as I thought. But they did help me to be more familiar with MATLAB, this meaning is more important than what they could do.

In the voice synthesis project, first we figured out what parts a voice synthesis model involves, and after that we finished a model based on codes provided, to generate the voice signal. We also learned how to process sound signals, which is strongly related to the course we just had finished: Signal and System.

In the image processing, we could know how to do the JPEG compression, that is really interesting and inspiring for me. We also learned how to put some messages in a picture without damaging the picture. Finally a easy face detect project is finished, which is based on color character. Obviously this acts not that great, because it just use 28 faces as training set and use color vector to describe it, deep learning or some convolution things did not appear. You could imagine the result.
